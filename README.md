# Cybersecurity : CSN150
Project: ESP32 XXXXXXXX

## Purpose
Set up ESP32 and Arduino enviornment. Execute sketch " Wifiscanner". 

## Equipment
* [ESP32Cam](https://www.amazon.com/Aideepen-ESP32-CAM-Bluetooth-ESP32-CAM-MB-Arduino/dp/B08P2578LV/ref=sr_1_3?crid=4FY0ECFW0ZX7&keywords=ESP32+Cam&qid=1678902050&sprefix=esp32+cam%2Caps%2C240&sr=8-3)

* [USB Micro Data Cable](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Male-Micro-Cable-Black/dp/B0711PVX6Z/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=micro+usb+data+cable&qid=1678902214&sprefix=Micro+USB+data+%2Caps%2C89&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFaU0NaUVZHU1RFUlAmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA3NTA4MDVFVERCS01HVlgxM1YmZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDE4NTE1NTIwWUdONkdWSzU1M1Amd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl)

## Links to documentation and tools

## Steps I followed
1. Look through the examples on arduino scrolling down to Wi-FI tab extending it to reveal Wifi-Scan sketch.
2. Make sure you chose the correct board in the board and port drop down menu
3. You should be able to upload it to your esp32 board as is.
4. After its done compileing you can click the serial monitor button on the top right of the arduino programs.
5. You notice that their is no proper output in the drop down menu their is buad option make sure you set it to the value that set in setup()
6. This example is 115200 after setting that and waiting a bit you should get a proper output on different networks in range. 

## Problems and Solutions
I tried to upload without the esp32 cam plugged in, I didn't recieve an error the button just didn't do anything. Solution is to plug it in next time and selecting the proper board after.

## Final Report
As this project was done in class, I didn't have a problem repeating the steps we did in the class enviorment at my home. If that were not the case it would probably be a lot more difficult of a project if I have to design my own wifi-scanner from scratch. Though the overall project is pretty cool, In the future it is something I would like to learn to do without help from arduino documentation.
